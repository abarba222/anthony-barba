The design and development of an application in terms of the user interface is very important to me and I take great pride in creating not only well functioning but intriguingly designed apps.   My training includes the understanding and implementation of AJAX and JSON data as well as knowledge with JavaScript frameworks like Backbone and Ember.</p>\n                <p class=\"about-me-disclaimer\"><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I understand this site does not meet proper design principles but each background describes a favorite book or interest of mine and I thought this would be a fun way to show part of my personality.</p>\n              </div>\n\n        </div>\n\n      </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n    <a id=\"resume\"></a>\n\n    <div class=\"third-background\">\n\n      <div class=\"resume-content\">\n\n        <h2 class=\"resume-header\">Resume</h2>\n\n        <div class=\"third-nav\">\n          <a href=\"#top\" class=\"third-top\">TOP</a>\n          <a href=\"#aboutme\" class=\"third-about-me\">ABOUT ME</a>\n          <a href=\"#projects\" class=\"third-projects\">PROJECTS</a>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"resume-scroll\">\n\n          <p class=\"my-resume\">\n            <p>\n                <strong> </strong>\n            </p>\n            <br clear=\"ALL\"/>\n            <p class=\"my-resume\">\n                <strong>Academic Degree:</strong>\n                <strong> </strong>\n                BA in Communications Studies;
